To specify/change in the Wiki:
- Several predicates (input, input_line) have a limitation.
  They can only handle strings of size Sys.max_string_length 
  (that is approx. 16M on a 32bits machine and 2^57 on a 64bits machine.)
  Please report an issue if you need more than this.
- The minimum number of characters to be read with the input predicate is now 1
- opening a file and binding it to two different variables lead to unspecified 
  behavior (at some point this should be specified) 


=> Fails if one IO test fails (and provides a way to run all of them anyway)

For all IO predicates, we should test what happens with an unbound variable
if a variable of a given type is expected.

open_in
-> behavior OK when:
  * opening a correct file
  * opening an incorrect file
  * opening two times the same file (binding to same and diff variables)

close_in
-> behavior OK when:
  * closing an opened file
  * closing two times the same opened file

read
-> behavior OK when:
  * parsing over multiple lines

readterm
-> behavior OK when:
  * parsing a period terminated string from a file
  * specifying std_in as the input stream

input_line
-> behavior OK when
  * reading something from the stdin arbitrary long and with any characters
  * trying to read something from stdout or stderr
-> Todo input_from a file

input
-> behavior OK when:
  * reading less than the number of characters available
  * reading more than the number of characters available 
	(reads the max in this case)
  * reading over multiple lines
  * input several times on the same stream
  * TODO: from std_in
  * trying to read whereas the stream is closed


string_to_term
-> TODO
