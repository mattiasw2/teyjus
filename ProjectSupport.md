The research that has led to the development of Version 2 of the _Teyjus_ implementation of _Lambda Prolog_ has received generous support from the National Science Foundation over the years. Early work on the logical foundations of _Lambda Prolog_ and on developing the basic framework for its efficient implementation was supported by the NSF Grants CCR-8905825, CCR-9208465 and CCR-9596119. These grants facilitated, for instance, the development of one of the earliest explicit substitution calculus, envisaged at that time as the means for providing an efficient representation for lambda terms, the design of an abstract machine and the verification of a significant part of this machine, a task carried out in the doctoral thesis of Keehang Kwon. The NSF Grants CCR-9803849 and CCR-0096322 enabled the refinement of the initial virtual machine, the development of methods for realizing modularity and the compilation techniques that are manifest in Version 1 of the _Teyjus_ system. Finally, NSF Grant CCF-0429572 has supported the development of a pattern unification algorithm suitable for low-level implementations, the restructuring of the virtual machine around this operation, the design of separate compilation techniques and, perhaps most importantly, the realization of all these ideas in Version 2 of _Teyjus_. Work in recent years has also been supported by a grant from the Graduate School at the University of Minnesota and by funds received from the Computer Science and Engineering Department of the University of Minnesota.
