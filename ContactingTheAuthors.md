# Contacting the Authors #

The _Teyjus_ project aspires to a truly open perspective and has the objective of developing ideas and software that are meant for free public use. In keeping with this spirit, it also encourages the participation of members of the larger research community. The project members would be happy to receive feedback in the form of bug reports or suggestions for improvement from the users of the _Teyjus_ system. Such feedback would typically be provided through the [Issues](http://code.google.com/p/teyjus/issues/list) forum.

You are, of course, also welcome to contact current project members concerning specific ideas or details underlying the system or if you would like to contribute to its development. While you can approach any team member with such questions, here is a guide to the best possible contact for particular kinds of issues:

_Andrew Gacek_ `[`andrew dot gacek atsign gmail dot com`]`
> for matters related to overall system structure, general issues related to the logic and _Teyjus_ programming or if you want to get the attention of any of the others quickly

_Steven Holte_ `[`sholte atsign gmail dot com`]`
> for details about the treatment of separate compilation and the linking and loading schemes present in the _Teyjus_ system

_Gopalan Nadathur_  `[`gopalan atsign cs dot umn dot edu`]`
> if you are interested in finding out about ongoing developments and possible projects or if you want to discuss new ideas that you have related to _Teyjus_-like languages and systems

_Xiaochu Qi_ `[`xqi atsign cs dot umn dot edu`]`
> if you want the low-down on the virtual machine, the compiler, the treatment of portability issues and the code that realizes these various aspects; in short if you want any information about the real heart of the _Teyjus_ system

_Zachary Snow_ `[`zacharysnow atsign gmail dot com`]`
> for questions about the front-end of the compiler, the treatment of types or if you would like to hear about the ongoing project aimed at implementing _Twelf_ using the _Lambda Prolog_ machine
