# The Structure of a Signature #

The Teyjus parser for signatures is a combination of a "pre-parser" automatically generated by the _OCaml_ parser generator from a context-free grammar and a post processor that manipulates the pre-abstract syntax structures generated from the grammar. The post processing phase is needed to handle information such as the arities of type constructors that is also gleaned through the (pre-)parse. The grammar below describes a syntax that is the sum total of these two phases. It is presented in this way to explicate signature syntax to the user of a system and is not to be confused with the context-free grammar description that is given to the parser generator.

## Commentary on Signature Syntax ##

The declarations in a signature file must satisfy certain properties in addition to being derivable from the grammar rules:

  * Each signature is expected to be presented in a distinct file. This file must have the name `<modname>.sig` where `<modname>` is the name of the relevant module and signature. This name should also coincide with the name indicated in the signature header, generated by the rule for `<SigHeader>`.

  * A signature may accumulate or use another signature via an _accum`_`sig_ or _use`_`sig_ declaration. Before it becomes meaningful to deem a given signature as well-formed, each of its accumulated and used signatures should be determined to be so by the same rules that are described in this commentary. Notice, in particular, that a modularity principle for signatures is implied by this: each signature must be understood independently and completely, i.e., the context of its accumulation or use has no impact on this understanding.

  * The intended effect of _accum`_`sig_ declarations is to include the declarations in the named signatures in the signature being generated from the text in the present file. Thus, _accum`_`sig_ functions in a manner similar to _#include_ in C. The possible interactions between sibling accumulated signatures and the accumulating signature are discussed further below.

  * Kind declarations are those expressions in the category `<Sign-Decl>` that begin with the token kind. The purpose of these declarations is to identify sorts and type constructors that may be used in determining types for constants and variables. Thus a declaration of the form
```
           kind  foo  type -> ... -> type
```

> with n+1 occurrences of type identifies foo as a type constructor of arity n. (If n is 0 the object identified is a sort.) Note that there are restrictions built into the grammar rules on the syntax of tokens that can be identified as sorts and type constructors.

  * Type abbreviation declarations are those expressions in the category `<Sign-Decl>` that begin with the token _typeabbrev_. The purpose of these declarations is to identify names that can be used as shorthands in type expressions. These names can also be parameterized. For example, a declaration of the form
```
          typeabbrev   (bar A)   list A -> list A
```

> allows _(bar int)_ to be used as an abbreviation for the expression _list int -> list int_ in the type expressions described below. There is a restriction on the type expressions that figure in such a declaration: any variable that is used in them must have been identified as a "parameter" of the name that is being identified as an abbreviation. This explanation has a "forward reference": in assumes an understanding of type expressions that appears later in this sequence.

  * Tokens that are identified as the names of abbreviations have an appearance in syntax that is similar to that of sorts and type constructors. We shall refer to all of these kinds of symbols collectively as type constants when there is no need to make finer distinctions.

  * Type declarations are those expressions in the category `<Sign-Decl>` that begin with the token _type_. Type declarations identify term constants with their associated types. Note that the constants for which types can be so declared have a limited syntax. In particular, they should not begin with an uppercase letter or the underscore (`_`) character.

  * Type expressions are constructed, as expected, from type constants, type variables and the arrow type constructor written as _->_. Tokens appearing in such expressions are classified as type variables or type constants depending on whether or not they begin with an uppercase letter or the underscore (`_`) character. In understanding the structure of potentially ambiguous type expressions, the following convention is to be used: the application of a type constructor to types is left associative and has higher precedence than the construction of an arrow type; i.e. _(tc ty1 ... tyn -> sort)_ is read as _((...(tc ty1)...tyn) -> sort)_.

  * A requirement for a type-expression to be well-formed is that every type constant that appears in it and that is not built-in must be previously defined. In determining this, (a) every sort, type constructor and type abbreviation defined in an accumulated or used signature is assumed to be available before any type expression in this signature is processed, (b) every sort and type constructor defined in this signature is assumed to be available before the type expression in any type abbreviation declaration is processed, (c) type abbreviations introduced by declarations physically preceding another such declaration are assumed to be available in interpreting the type expression in the new type abbreviation declaration and (d) every sort, type constructor and type abbreviation defined by a declaration in the signature is assumed to be available at the type a type declaration is processed.

  * Another requirement for a type expression to be well-formed is that every type constructor and every identifier that names an abbreviation that appears in it must be supplied with a full complement of argument types, i.e. the usage of a type constant must be consistent with its declaration.

  * A well-formed type expression denotes the type that is obtained by replacing each type abbreviation used within it by the fully expanded type expression that it corresponds to; what is meant by "expansion" in this context is discussed informally in the comment explaining type abbreviations and we expect that this notion is unambiguously understood at this point.

  * Operator declarations are those expressions in the category `<Sign-Decl>` that are further characterized by the form
```
       	 <Fixity> <Ids> <SmallInt> '.' 
```

> Such declarations identify relevant (term) constants as being infix, prefix or postfix operators that are not associative, left associative or right associative and having a specified precedence. Types of constants that are defined as operators must be consistent with their interpretation as such.

  * Exportdef and useonly declarations are expressions in the `<Sign-Decl>` category that begin with the tokens exportdef and useonly, respectively. exportdef and useonly declarations must pertain to predicate constants only, i.e. constants with a target type o. exportdef declarations identify the relevant constants as ones whose definitions emanating from the module associated with the signature must not change. useonly declarations play a complementary role: these identify predicates that might be used in the module associated with the signature but whose definitions cannot be further refined there. exportdef and useonly declarations can also identify types with the relevant constants. In this case, the type expressions must satisfy all the requirements required of them relative to type declarations of the usual form.

  * The intended effect of use`_`sig declarations is similar to that of accum`_`sig declarations with one change: every exportdef declaration appearing in the signature being included (or accumulated) must first be changed to a useonly declaration of the same constants. Intuitively, use`_`sig declarations serve to identify predicates (and associated constants and kinds) in the signature of a "consumer;" the change in annotation from exportdef to useonly signals that these predicates can be used but must not be redefined or extended in any code possessing the signature.

  * There must be at most one type, one kind or type abbreviation and one fixity identification per Id. There might be multiple declarations in each category for this Id but all must agree eventually within that category. Also, no predicate should be defined both useonly and exportdef in any given module.

  * Fixity declarations must be for constants defined in the signature.

  * In accum`_`sig and use`_`sig declarations, the meaning of the renamings is as follows. If there are no curly brackets, all symbols from the corresponding signature are available to the current signature. If there are curly brackets, then only the symbols listed will have their types and kinds available. As constants and type constructors (together with type abbreviations) are in different namespaces, it needs to be specified which one is being referred to. So to refer to a constant called foo, the notation here is "type foo" and to refer to a type or type constructor or type abbreviation called foo, the notation is "kind foo". Only the symbols listed in the curly brackets will be available, and if there is an arrow in the declaration, then they will be renamed to the name after the arrow.

  * There are two requirements on the renaming list of accum`_`sig and use`_`sig declarations. The first is that the renaming mapping be injective. That is, two things cannot be renamed to the same name. Notice that there are two different name spaces, one for sorts and type constructors identified by kind declarations and another for term constants identified by type declarations, and the injectivity requirement is to be interpreted on a per namespace basis. The second requirement is that all the types in the signature be coherent assuming that only the pervasive kinds and the ones explicitly mentioned in the restriction to the signature are visible. In other words, all the types in type abbreviations and in the types of the constants mentioned in the restriction should use only the kinds in this set.

GN: This stuff is for the developers and should not be in the manual itself
In the case of constants, this would have problematic semantics with respect to unification: the two symbols would unify in the accumulating module but not the accumulated module. In the case of types, it would be problematic because the accumulating module would have more flexibility than the accumulated module in terms of what terms may be arguments to what.

GN: Again useful for developers but not part of the manual.
Otherwise, there would be no way to make sense of the constant.
