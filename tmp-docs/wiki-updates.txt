Running list of what needs to be updated and/or added to the wiki.

  * We extended the renaming syntax with the '*' token that includes everything
    not mentioned. Any renamings superceed the inclusion of the renamed
    type/kind.

  * An empty renaming should be ignored and print a warning message

  * We should document how clashes are being handled
